Leoni Framework
====

A simple lightweight MVC framework made for starters and/or WordPress lovers.
Although you don't need to be using WordPress in your project or even be a WordPress fan to use this Framework, if you are, you gonna love it even more.

Leoni Framework comes with a plugin (which you can disable as you wish) that help integrating your application to a WordpPress Blog.

I created this Framework when developing plugins for WordPress became unmaintainable, WordPress by nature doesn't provide any support to Object Oriented coding, and as I huge fan of O.O I couldn't take it anymore! I couldn't find any suitable MVC tool to work with WordPress so I figured why not build my own?

Leoni Framework allows you to build MVC web applications without having to reinvent the wheel every time you need something simple such as a MVC structure or a database connection. You won't need to do any server configuration or such thing, this framework is super lightweight which means it can run in any simple server with great speed.

Enjoy!
