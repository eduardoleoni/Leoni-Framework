Leoni Framework
====

A simple lightweight MVC framework made for starters or Wordpress lovers.
Although you don't need to be using WordPress in your project or even be a WordPress Fan to use this Framework, if you are, you gonna love it way more.

Leoni Framework comes with a plugin (which you can disable as you wish) to help integrating your application with your WordpPress Blog.

I gave birth to this Framework when developing pluigns for WordPress became unmaintainable, WordPress by nature doesn't provide any support to Object Oriented codding, and as I huge fan of O.O I couldn't take it anymore! I couldn't find any suitable MVC tool to work with Wordpress so I figured why not build my own?

Leoni Framework allows you to build MVC websites without having to rebuild the wheel everytime you need something simple such as a MVC structure or database connection. You won't need to any server configuration or such thing, this framework is really lightweight which means it can run in any small server with great speed.

Enjoy!
